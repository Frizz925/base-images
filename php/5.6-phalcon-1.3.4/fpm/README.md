PHPDocker.io - PHP 5.6 / FPM container with Phalcon 1.3.4
=========================================================

Debian Jessie PHP 5.6 / FPM container for [PHPDocker.io](http://phpdocker.io) projects.

This is identical to the regular frizz925/php56-fpm except it has Phalcon 1.3.4 installed.

*Note on logging:* configure your application to stream logs into `php://stdout`. That's it.
